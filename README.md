# 🛒 E-commerce Funnel Optimization

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the e-commerce conversion funnel using cohort analysis, funnel analysis, and customer retention strategies. It provides actionable insights to improve user engagement, retention rates, and sales performance.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

In any e-commerce business, understanding user behavior across the funnel is crucial to maximize conversions and minimize drop-offs.  
This project aims to:

- Track user journeys through various stages (landing → browsing → cart → purchase).
- Identify major drop-off points in the funnel.
- Perform cohort analysis to track retention across different time periods.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve user conversion rates.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data analysis and processing
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **SQL**: Data extraction and cohort analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploration and presentation
- **Excel**: Additional analysis and reporting

---

## 📈 Key Techniques

- **Funnel Analysis**: Measuring the percentage of users at each stage.
- **Time Cohort Analysis**: Grouping users based on their signup or first purchase time.
- **Retention Analysis**: Understanding how user activity evolves over time.
- **Drop-off Analysis**: Identifying where users leave the funnel and why.

✅ **What you can do next (optional but professional):**

- Create folders like `/data/`, `/notebooks/`, `/sql_queries/`, and `/reports/` if you haven't already.
- Add a `requirements.txt` with libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `jupyter` if needed.
- Add some visuals from your funnel/cohort plots inside the README too if you want to make it even more attractive!

Would you like me to also create a **small preview of a Cohort Retention Heatmap** or **example funnel chart** you can upload as images for your README? 🚀 (It will make it look even better.)  
Want me to? 🎯
